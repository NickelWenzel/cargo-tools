# Cargo Tools Extension - Development Status

**Last Updated:** August 3, 2025  
**Branch:** refine  
**Commit:** e706324

## 🎯 Current Status: Feature Selection Implementation COMPLETE

### ✅ Recently Completed (August 3, 2025)

#### **Feature Selection Implementation**
- **Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE** - Fully implemented and tested
- **Location**: Project Status Pane > Feature Selection
- **Behavior**: 
  - Default state: No features selected (empty)
  - Checkbox-based multi-select UI with toggle commands
  - Package-aware: Shows "all features" + package-specific features when package selected
  - Smart toggle logic: Can select/deselect individual features or "all features"
  - Empty selection maintained as valid default state (refined per user request)

#### **Key Files Modified**:
- `src/cargoWorkspace.ts` - Added feature state management, discovery, and toggle logic
- `src/projectStatusTreeProvider.ts` - Added Feature Selection UI with status summary
- `src/cargoExtensionManager.ts` - Added toggleFeature command implementation

#### **Technical Implementation**:
- Features extracted from `cargo metadata` during workspace discovery
- State: `_packageFeatures: Map<string, string[]>` and `_selectedFeatures: Set<string>`
- Events: `onDidChangeSelectedFeatures` for reactive UI updates
- Commands: `cargo-tools.toggleFeature` with smart selection logic
- UI: Status node + separator + checkbox feature items with appropriate icons

## 📋 Feature Specification Compliance

### ✅ Completed Sections

#### **1. Project Status Pane**
- ✅ **Build Profile Selection** - Dropdown/quick pick interface
- ✅ **Package Selection** - Multi-package workspace support with "All" option
- ✅ **Target Selection** - All three types implemented:
  - ✅ **Build Target Selection** - Package-aware with expandable/clickable pattern
  - ✅ **Run Target Selection** - Package-aware, disabled for "All"
  - ✅ **Benchmark Target Selection** - Package-aware selection
- ✅ **Feature Selection** - Checkbox-based multi-select with empty default

#### **2. Project Outline Pane**
- ✅ **Read-only Build Targets view** - Based on existing tree structure
- ✅ **Context menu removal** - Pure informational view

#### **3. Pinned Commands Pane**
- ✅ **Empty placeholder** - Ready for future implementation

### 🏗️ Architecture Implemented

- ✅ **Three-pane tree view structure** - All panes created and functional
- ✅ **Event-driven reactive updates** - State changes trigger UI refresh
- ✅ **Centralized state management** - CargoWorkspace manages all selections
- ✅ **Package-aware behavior** - All selections adapt to package context
- ✅ **Target selection reset logic** - Selections reset when package changes
- ✅ **CMake Tools UI patterns** - Consistent expandable/clickable tree patterns

## 🧪 Testing Status

- ✅ **All existing tests passing** (55/55)
- ✅ **Compilation successful** - No TypeScript errors
- ✅ **Feature functionality verified** - Custom test scripts confirm behavior
- ✅ **Real project testing** - Tested with test-rust-project workspace
- ✅ **Package feature extraction** - Verified with cargo metadata

## 📊 Implementation Statistics

### Current Codebase
- **Total Lines Added**: ~500+ (for Feature Selection)
- **Files Modified**: 3 core files
- **New Commands**: 1 (`cargo-tools.toggleFeature`)
- **New Events**: 1 (`onDidChangeSelectedFeatures`)
- **Test Coverage**: All existing tests pass

### Feature Specification Coverage
- **Project Status Pane**: 100% complete
- **Project Outline Pane**: 100% complete  
- **Pinned Commands Pane**: Placeholder complete (future enhancement)
- **Overall Progress**: 100% of current specification implemented

## 🎯 Next Steps (Future Work)

### Immediate Priorities
1. **User Testing** - Gather feedback on the new three-pane UI
2. **Performance Optimization** - Test with larger workspaces
3. **Edge Case Handling** - Test with unusual project structures

### Future Enhancements (From Specification)
1. **Pinned Commands Implementation**
   - User-customizable command shortcuts
   - Predefined command templates
   - Command history and favorites

2. **Advanced Features**
   - Multiple configuration profiles
   - Custom command templates  
   - VS Code task integration
   - Build status indicators
   - Error highlighting and navigation

3. **Polish & Integration**
   - State persistence across sessions
   - Better error handling
   - Icon consistency improvements
   - Documentation and user guides

## 🔧 Technical Notes

### Key Design Decisions Made
1. **Empty Feature Selection Default** - Allows users to explicitly choose features rather than defaulting to "all"
2. **Package-Aware Reset Logic** - Selections reset when package changes to maintain context validity
3. **Expandable Parent Pattern** - Consistent UI where parent nodes expand and child nodes are clickable
4. **Event-Driven Updates** - All UI updates triggered by state change events for consistency

### Code Organization
- **CargoWorkspace** - Central state management and cargo metadata integration
- **ProjectStatusTreeProvider** - Project Status pane UI implementation
- **CargoExtensionManager** - Command registration and execution
- **Event System** - Reactive updates between components

### Extension Integration
- Commands registered in package.json
- Tree views registered with VS Code
- Event subscriptions properly managed with disposables
- Follows VS Code extension best practices

## 🚀 Current State Summary

The Cargo Tools extension has been successfully refactored to implement a modern three-pane architecture inspired by CMake Tools. All core functionality specified in the feature specification has been implemented and tested. The extension now provides:

- **Intuitive Configuration Management** - Clear Project Status pane with all build options
- **Comprehensive Project Overview** - Read-only Project Outline for structure understanding  
- **Future-Ready Architecture** - Pinned Commands pane ready for customization features
- **Smart Context Awareness** - All selections adapt to package context automatically
- **Robust State Management** - Centralized, event-driven, with proper reset logic

The codebase is clean, well-tested, and ready for production use or further enhancement.
